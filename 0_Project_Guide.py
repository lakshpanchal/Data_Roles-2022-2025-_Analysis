This project analyzes trends in technical tool usage across job postings from 2022 to 2025, using a cleaned and enriched dataset spanning thousands of listings across industries, roles, and companies.

It focuses on identifying how specific technologies (e.g., Python, Airflow, SQL) evolve in popularity over timeâ€”not just in raw counts, but through normalized trends that adjust for varying monthly job volumes. This ensures that insights reflect true demand signals rather than skewed totals from high-volume years.

Interactive filters, KPIs, and regression-based trendlines help uncover how different tools rise or fall in usage across time, roles, and industries.
